Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_pll_i is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 14 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins u_ddr3/u_ddr3_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/gen_mmcm.mmcm_i/CLKFBOUT]
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -hier -filter {NAME =~ */u_iodelay_ctrl/sys_rst}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '8' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
